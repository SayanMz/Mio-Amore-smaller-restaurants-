# Mio-Amore-smaller-restaurants-
This is my #1st time using GitHub. My first android app is Mio Amore. I am showcasing this as my portfolio. 
So what this app does?
There are a list of item names with some useless checkbox and that is the menu and at right, there is a quantity bar with '+' and '-' buttons which maintains the int value by +1 and -1.
After done with the quantity just hit the "ORDER SUMMARY" button to see your bill and if clicked on "ORDER NOW", it will call a common intent to share this data with other applications such as Email.
